# Internship Project Report: Privacy Notes App

## Introduction
The Privacy Notes App is a secure, client-side web application designed to allow users to create, store, and manage private notes. The application emphasizes user privacy by implementing encryption and local storage, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and is not transmitted to external servers.

## Objectives
- Develop a simple and user-friendly notes application.
- Ensure all notes are encrypted before storage.
- Store notes locally on the user's device to maximize privacy.
- Provide basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for notes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Local Storage API
- Custom cryptography module for encryption/decryption

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete notes.
- All notes are encrypted using a passphrase before being saved.
- Notes are stored in the browser's local storage.
- Responsive and clean user interface.

## Implementation Details
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure and UI elements.
- `styles.css`: Styling for the application.
- `app.js`: Handles UI logic, user interactions, and integrates storage and crypto modules.
- `crypto.js`: Provides encryption and decryption functions.
- `storage.js`: Manages saving and retrieving notes from local storage.

## Challenges Faced
- Ensuring robust encryption and secure passphrase handling.
- Managing state and updates in local storage efficiently.
- Designing a simple yet effective user interface.

## Outcomes
- Successfully developed a privacy-focused notes application.
- Gained experience in client-side encryption and secure storage.
- Improved skills in JavaScript modularization and UI design.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for note categories or tags.
- Implement password recovery options.


## Conclusion
The Privacy Notes App demonstrates the importance of privacy in everyday applications. By encrypting data and keeping it on the client side, users can trust that their information remains secure. This project provided valuable experience in secure web development and user-centric design.
